# Privacy Policy and Terms of Service Deployment Test Report

**Date:** August 28, 2025  
**Website:** https://aiconversionads.netlify.app/

## Test Results

### ❌ **Issue Identified: Pages Not Deployed**

The Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages have been created locally and committed to the Git repository, but they are not yet available on the live Netlify site.

**Evidence:**
- Privacy Policy URL returns 404: https://aiconversionads.netlify.app/privacy-policy.html
- Terms of Service URL returns 404: https://aiconversionads.netlify.app/terms-of-service.html

### ✅ **Local Files Created Successfully**

The following files have been created and committed to the Git repository:
- `/home/ubuntu/marketing-website/privacy-policy.html` - Complete Privacy Policy page
- `/home/ubuntu/marketing-website/terms-of-service.html` - Complete Terms of Service page
- `/home/ubuntu/marketing-website/index.html` - Updated with footer links

### ✅ **Footer Links Added**

The main website now includes a footer with links to:
- Privacy Policy
- Terms of Service

However, these links currently lead to 404 pages because the files haven't been deployed yet.

## Next Steps Required

1. **Push Git Repository to Remote:** The local Git repository needs to be pushed to a remote repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
2. **Trigger Netlify Deployment:** Once pushed to remote, Netlify should automatically deploy the updated files
3. **Verify Deployment:** Test that both pages are accessible after deployment

## Files Ready for Deployment

All necessary files are prepared and committed locally:
- Privacy Policy page with professional styling
- Terms of Service page with comprehensive legal content
- Updated main page with functional footer links
- All pages use consistent Tailwind CSS styling

The deployment is pending the push to the remote Git repository connected to Netlify.
